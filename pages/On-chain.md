- Data or code is considered to be "on-chain" if is contained within or affects the current State of the CVM.
  
  On-chain data is the *only* information that is visible to the CVM. It can be accessed and used by Actors, e.g. as part of the management of smart contracts and digital assets.
  
  As a general principle, on-chain data should be kept to the *absolute minimum necessary*. This is because:
- It has a real cost (in terms of both coins and memory)
- It is effectively public information so should exclude any confidential or private information
