- A dApp is a decentralised application.
  
  We can distinguish between two forms of Dapp:
- **Pure dApp** - the Dapp consists only of client code and on-chain implementation (i.e. the Dapp depends on the Convex network and nothing else). Such Dapps are simple to build and maintain, and minimise the risk of relying on centralised systems
- **Hybrid dApp** - the Dapp uses client code, on-chain-implementation and one or more off-chain servers. This is more complex to build and maintain, but is necessary if additional servers are required (e.g. to store private information, or to integrate with external systems)
