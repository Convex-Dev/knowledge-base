alias:: CVM

- ---
- General-purpose execution engine powering [[Convex]]
-
- that can be used to implement the State transitions triggered by Transactions in the Convex Network.
-
- The CVM is Turing complete, and is capable of executing arbitrary logic. It enforces constraints upon computation costs and memory usage to ensure that Users are unable to abuse shared resources (making Denial of Service attacks prohibitively expensive, for example).
